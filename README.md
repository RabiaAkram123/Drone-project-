# Drone Project

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies and tools to build and control the drone:

- **Python 3** — 
- **OpenCV** — For image processing and face tracking.
- **Drone SDK (e.g., DJI Tello SDK or any other drone SDK you use)** — To communicate and send commands to the drone.
- **Keyboard Input Handling** — 
- **Mapping Algorithms** — 
- **Other Libraries** — Such as `numpy`, `time`,

## What I Have Done in This Project

- Implemented **basic drone movements** (takeoff, landing, forward/backward, left/right, up/down).
- Developed a **face tracking module** that uses computer vision to detect and follow a face autonomously.
- Created scripts for **capturing images** directly from the drone’s camera.
- Built **keyboard controls** to manually pilot the drone with simple keypresses.
- Integrated **mapping functionalities** to help with navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- Combined keyboard control and image capture for real-time operation.
- Created test scripts to verify drone control features.
